# Inflation
## What is inflation

### Broad increase in prices
In a market economy, prices for goods and services can always change. Some prices rise; some prices fall. One speaks of inflation if there is a broad increase in the prices of goods and services, not just of individual items. As a result, you can buy less for £1. Expressed the other way around, a pound is worth less than it was before.

It is important to understand that the increase in prices has to be broad and general in nature.

For example, a particularly cold winter and spring may affect the quantity of wine produced in southern Europe. Should market demand remain unchanged in the face of a reduced supply, the expectation is for wine prices to increase. In this case we would not speak of _inflation_ but, perhaps, of _wine price inflation_.

On a different perspective, following the outcome of the Brexit referendum, the British Pound devalued against the Euro and the US Dollar, making more expensive all imports priced in those currencies. In this case we would speak of _inflation_, as the effect of the devaluation is a _broad_ increase in prices.

The cause of inflation, of course, must be clearly identified before any mitigating policy is applied.

### Some price changes are more important than others
When calculating the average increase in prices, the prices of products we spend more on – such as electricity – are given a greater weight than the prices of products we spend less on – for example, sugar or postage stamps.

### Different people buy different things
Every household has different spending habits: some have a car and eat meat, others travel solely by public transport or are vegetarian. The average spending habits of all households together determine how much weight the different products and services have in the measurement of inflation.

For measuring inflation, all goods and services that households consume are taken into account, including:

- everyday items (such as food, newspapers and petrol)
- durable goods (such as clothing, PCs and washing machines)
- services (such as hairdressing, insurance and rented housing)

### Compare the price of the shopping basket from year to year

All the goods and services consumed by households during the year are represented by a _basket_ of items. Every product in this basket has a price, which can change over time. The annual rate of inflation is the price of the total basket in a given month compared with its price in the same month one year previously.

#### Example for calculating inflation

|Quantities bought in the base year |Price |(base)|Price |(Year 1)|Price|(Year 2)|
|-----------------------------------|------:|--:|-------:|-:|------:|-:|
|      | per unit| total| per unit | total | per unit | total|
|150 loaves of bread| £1.50|£225|£1.30|£195|£1.60|£240|
|100 cups of coffee|£2.40|£240|£2.40|£240|£2.15|£215|
|12 haircut|£20| £240|£22|£264|£23|£276|
|1 winter jacket|£145|£145|£176|£176|£160|£160|
|**Total cost of basket**| |£850| |£875| |£891|
|**Price index**| | 100| | 102.9| | 104.8|
|**Inflation rate**| | | | __2.9%__| | __1.8%__|

#### Steps
1.  List all the products in your basket and the quantities you consumed in a given year (this will be your “base year”).In our example we take just bread, coffee, haircuts and a winter jacket.
2.  Calculate the total expenditure for each of the products by multiplying the quantities purchased by the price you paid for them: 150 loaves of bread x £1.50 = £225 100 cups of coffee x £2.40 = £240, etc.
3.  Add up the totals for all the products to get the total cost of consumption. In our base year it’s £850. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the following years.
4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the following years.Looking at the example you will see that, after the first year, some prices changed. The total cost of consumption has risen to £875. After the second year, it's £891.
5.  Divide the total cost of the basket in each subsequent year by the cost of the basket in your base year, then multiply the result by 100. One year later: £875 ÷ £850 x 100 = 102.9
6.  The annual rate of inflation is the percentage change from one year to the next. In the example, after one year the inflation rate is 2.9%. This is calculated as the price index for that year minus the price index for the previous year (102.9 – 100), divided by the price index for the previous year (100) multiplied by 100. For the following year it's (104.8 – 102.9) ÷ 102.9 x 100 = 1.8%.

The formula to calculate **inflation rate** is

$$
i = \frac{P_2 - P_1}{P_1} \times 100
$$
where
$P_1$ : price in time period 1
$P_2$ : price in time period 2

The formula to calculate **price index** is
$$
Price \: Index = \frac{P_t}{P_0} \times 100
$$
where
$P_t$ : price at time period t
$P_0$ : price at base year


## Quantity theory of money
Let's suppose that we have a very small economy which produces two goods (coffee and pen) and one service (city bus travel). In this economy there is only one £1 banknote and we will look at the output of the economy of one period. John owns the £1 banknote and buys a coffee for £1 from Janet. Janet spends her £1 to buy a pen from Mark. Mark spend his £1 banknote to purchase a bus ticket.

The £1 banknote has circulated 3 times in the period. The real output of the economy is given by the goods and services sold in the time period: 3. The price of the each good/service was £1. Hence, we can write that

$$
M \times V = P \times Y
$$
where
+ $M$ : money supply - £1
+ $V$ : money velocity - the number of times that money supply has circulated in the economy in the time period: 3
+ $P$ : price level - the price of the goods and services; £1
+ $Y$ : output - the total output of this economy in the time period: 3 goods/services. This is Real output
