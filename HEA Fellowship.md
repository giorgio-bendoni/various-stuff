### A1 - Design and plan learning activities and/or programmes of study
I was a gifted student and this has affected, for many years, my understanding of, and my approach to, the process of teaching and learning. I have grown under the misapprehension that complexity was a desirable feature of the teaching and learning process; that poor academic outcomes were solely a result of a general lack of will and commitment; that any attempt to pursue simplification was no more than seeking short cuts under disguise. I graduated from university two years earlier than my age group. This gift may come with other problems[^1]: difficulties in establishing relations with others, facing an ever increasing high level of expectations, confusing less than excellent results with complete failure[^2]. Luckily, my parents managed to direct me to exploit other talents, such as in music and sports, which allowed me to offset much of the negative externalities of being a gifted child.
Only upon becoming a father (of four) and being overly concerned for the academic results of my children, I realised (with the help on my wife) that I was very wrong to assume that everybody had my learning gift and that I could not possibly fully understand the struggles of those with normal, or lower than normal, learning abilities. One of my sons has learning difficulties. Something just clicked in my mind; a different perspective emerged and I started to see things that I could not see before. A major paradigm shift took place in the way I used to frame the L&T process.

Fast forward 15 years and I am the coordinator of two core modules in the course of Economics, Banking and Finance, a seminar tutor in Mathematics for Economists, the senior tutor and the digital champion for my Subject Group Economics and Finance.

Who is an economist? One of the most compelling descriptions of the preferable professional features and personal characteristics was provided by J M Keynes in its obituary essay for Alfred Marshall.

> _The study of economics does not seem to require any specialized gifts of an unusually high order. Is it not, intellectually regarded, a very easy subject compared with the higher branches of philosophy or pure science? An easy subject at which few excel! The paradox finds its explanation, perhaps, in that **the master-economist must possess a rare combination of gifts. He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher—in some degree. He must understand symbols and speak in words. He must contemplate the particular in terms of the general and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. He must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of man’s nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside his regard. He must be purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes as near to earth as a politician**_.” (Keynes, 1924)[^6]

Our university prides itself of offering the opportunity of Higher Education to students with lower academic academic results, often reflecting more challenging family background.

Difficulties in learning might be due to one or more of the following factors: an underlying learning disability  

My approach to preparing 


### A2 - Teach and/or support learning
The activity of teaching was, in the past twelve months, further affected by the COVID 19 pandemic which offered an _opportunity_ to more precisely identify and target the requirements and the direction of travel.  Even before the transition to the blended and connected model, I had investigated in detail the pedagogical perspective of the _flipped classroom_ model and identified its constituents.  developed a lecture plan for each lecture, stating each learning objective, relevant thresholds and workshop activities; the latter focusing on simplification of core concepts and constuction of  

### A3 - Assess and give feedback to learners
In theory the assessment strategy has to change to consider the redefined levels of knowledge and the type of skills identified at design stage of the lectures and workshops. 

### A4 - Develop effective learning environments and approaches to student support and guidance


### A5 - Engage in continuing professional development in subject/disciplines and their pedagogy, incorporating research, scholarship and the evaluation of professional practices

Professional development is a key component for the successful delivery of a pedagogically driven yet empirical and experimental change to teaching practices. I have approached my CPD in three directions: technology (existent/emergent); subject matter (economics); pedagogy (research, theoretical development and empirical observation, as applied to economics and statistics).
Technology - being kind of a nerd/geek, I find myself spending a large amount of hours every week following recent trends and development in technology; I only use open software, mainly for Linux or macOS machines. I have a computer solely dedicated to experimenting coding, new software packages (local or cloud based), knowledge management packages (obsidian), personal productivity, teaching and accessibility.
Subject matter -  I spend two hours a week to follow development in the areas directly related to my teaching (banking and finance) and to my wider interests (economics of conflicts and security, charities, and aerospace and maritime economics).
Pedagogy - I spend one hour a week to follow developments in pedagogical approaches applied to economics or statistics.  
I attend the various events organised by the university
